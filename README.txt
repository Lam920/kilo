+ TCSAFLUSH:  argument specifies when to apply the change, it waits for all 
pending output to be written to the terminal, and also discards any input that hasnâ€™t been read.
+ ECHO: print char we type into terminal
+ ICANON: read input line by line instead of char by char (press Enter to read a line)

- Software flow control:
+ Ctrl-S: Stops data from being transmitted to the terminal util you press 
+ Ctrl-Q
